      <description>Designing captivating, informative, and beautiful scientific presentations became a passion of mine during graduate school. When attending professional meetings, I quickly noticed the presentation styles that captured my attention and those that fell short. For me, how the information is conveyed visually is just as important the verbal or written delivery.</description>

      <description>I am a bumble bee ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes to the landscape and environment (e.g., agriculture and climate change) impact bumble bee behavior, colony growth and reproduction, and populations and communities. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher stationed at UC-Davis where I work with Neal Williams on bumble bee responses to heatwaves.
I recently completed my PhD with Claudio Gratton at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I sought to develop an understanding of how common species such as the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) cope with variable floral abundance brought about by agroecosystem management (e.</description>
