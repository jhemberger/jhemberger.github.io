      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved images. When I was young, I obsessed over the almost magical photo quality of my Dad&amp;rsquo;s old ViewMaster, intricate drawings of WW2 planes, and the bustling city scenes of my favorite childhood author, Richard Scary. This I think naturally led to an interest in making images, and I started snapping photos when I was still wearing footie pajamas.</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to my newly deployed website. It&amp;rsquo;s long been a project on my to-do list to migrate from Wordpress to something a bit less clunky, more simple, and that would help me learn more about coding for the web. I finally gathered (read: made) the time to sit down and write some code and deploy this new site via Hugo. In fact, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make this endeavor the topic of a soon-to-be-written blog post.</description>

      <description>Designing captivating, informative, and beautiful scientific presentations became a passion of mine during graduate school. When attending professional meetings, I quickly noticed the presentation styles that captured my attention and those that fell short. For me, how the information is conveyed visually is just as important the verbal or written delivery.</description>

      <description>I am a bumble bee ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes to the landscape and environment (e.g., agriculture and climate change) impact bumble bee behavior, colony growth and reproduction, and populations and communities. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher stationed at UC-Davis where I work with Neal Williams on bumble bee responses to heatwaves.
I recently completed my PhD with Claudio Gratton at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I sought to develop an understanding of how common species such as the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) cope with variable floral abundance brought about by agroecosystem management (e.</description>
