      <description>I really don&amp;rsquo;t like the Microsoft Office Suite. With the exception of PowerPoint (which I can almost always get to do what I want), the remainder of the suite, especially Word and Excel (NO, THAT COLUMN IS NOT A DATE, and even if it is, DO NOT REFORMAT IT), can be quite frustrating to work with.</description>

      <description>The chaos brought about by the global coronavirus pandemic has not only claimed lives, it has disrupted experiments in labs across the world. Many folks have been forced to scrap entire experiments, field seasons, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure, pursuit of their degree*. This sucks a lot, but it is a necessary step to ensure we reduce COVID spread and flatten the curve.</description>

      <description>If your situation is at all similar to mine right now, the COVID pandemic has greatly impacted day-to-day research operations and probably has had an impact on your productivity. Many of the tasks I queued up are now pushed way back, and there is a void of time that needs filling - preferably with something other than Netflix and binge-snacking&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved images. When I was young, I obsessed over the almost magical photo quality of my Dad&amp;rsquo;s old ViewMaster, intricate drawings of WW2 planes, and the bustling city scenes of my favorite childhood author, Richard Scary. This I think naturally led to an interest in making images, and I started snapping photos when I was still wearing footie pajamas.</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to my newly deployed website. It&amp;rsquo;s long been a project on my to-do list to migrate from Wordpress to something a bit less clunky, more simple, and that would help me learn more about coding for the web. I finally gathered (read: made) the time to sit down and write some code and deploy this new site via Hugo. In fact, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make this endeavor the topic of a soon-to-be-written blog post.</description>

      <description>Have you found my posts useful in your own work? Have you used my images in your presentations? Are my bee icons floating about on your powerpoint slide or in your own figures?
If any of the above or true, I&amp;rsquo;m so happy I could be helpful! Please consider buying me a coffee to help keep the content flowing your way.</description>

      <description>Designing captivating, informative, and beautiful scientific presentations became a passion of mine during graduate school. When attending professional meetings, I quickly noticed the presentation styles that captured my attention and those that fell short. For me, how the information is conveyed visually is just as important the verbal or written delivery.</description>

      <description>I am an ecologist and entomologist interested in how insect behavior, reproduction, populations, and communities respond to changes in the landscape, especially changes linked to agriculture and climate change. My work thus far has used on bumble bees as a model system, and I have grown rather fond of this taxon over the last 7 years.
Currently, I am a USDA NIFA postdoctoral fellow with Neal Williams investigating how bumble bees respond to heat waves - an extreme weather event projected to increase substantially in the next decade.</description>
